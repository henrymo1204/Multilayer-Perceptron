#### Intro
The project is built using Python. The program will calculate an output and adjust the weight between each node between the input and out layer according to the error from the target output. After each iterations, the program will have a better accuracy rate of guessing the output. The gradient is calculate using the Logistic function and a Learning Rate of 0.1 is pre-picked.

#### Contents:
- main.py
- NeuralNetwork.py
- test_2.txt
- README.txt

#### External Requirements (None?):
- Pre-installation of python

#### Setup and Installation (if any):
1. Extract the zip files into a folder.
2. Open terminal/console and change directory to the folder containing the files
3. Enter 'py main.py'
4. Program will iterate for 10,000 times and calculate the guesses.

#### Features (both included and missing):
- The program will iterate through 10,000 times and calculate the guesses.

#### Bugs (if any):
- Some outputs are still incorrect
